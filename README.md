# Gravity Simulator

This is just a fun lil project I worked on in which I simulate planets interacting with each other using gravity formulas (Physics!) and JavaScript. If you download it you can open the index.html file in a browser and play around with it yourself.

You can also watch how I coded this live on my twitch channel: https://twitch.tv/maxlascombe.
